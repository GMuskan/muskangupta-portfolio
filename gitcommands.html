            <h1>2. git init</h1>
            <p>A git repository must first be created before you can make commits or do anything else with it. We’ll use the git init command to create a new Git repository. The init subcommand stands for “initialise,” which is useful because it’s the command that handles all of a repository’s initial setup. In a moment, we’ll look at what it does. The git init command creates all of the necessary files and directories for Git to keep track of everything. All of these files are kept in a directory called .git (note the . at the beginning; this indicates that it will be hidden on Mac/Linux). The “repo” is this .git directory!</p>

            <h1>3. git clone</h1>
            <p>The command we’ll be doing on the terminal is git clone, which is how cloning is related to Git. The git clone command takes a path (typically a URL) to the Git repository you want to clone. The command is git clone, and the path to the Git repository you want to clone is passed as an argument. This is the URL for the project we’ll be working on throughout the course. git clone produces a local working copy of a remote repository’s source code. When you clone a repository, the code is downloaded to your machine automatically. If you have permission, this command will add the original location as a remote location, allowing you to grab changes from it and push changes to it.</p>

            <h1>4. git status</h1>
            <p>The git status command is our key to Git’s mind. It will inform us of Git’s thoughts and the state of our repository as seen by Git. When you’re first getting started, you should always use the git status command! Seriously. It’s a good idea to start running it after any other command. This will assist you in learning Git and avoiding making (potentially) inaccurate assumptions about the state of your files/repository.</p>

            <h1>5. git add</h1>
            <p>To move files from the Working Directory to the Staging Index, use the git add command. The git add command saves your changes in a file to the staging area, allowing you to compare your local version to the remote repository’s version. Before committing your new or changed file, use the git add command to add it to the staging area. To add specific files:</p>

You must include a brief description of the changes made every time you commit your code changes. This commit message aids others in comprehending the changes made.</p>

            <p>Add a new branch to an existing branch, list all existing branches, and delete a branch with git branch. This command is used to perform operations on a branch that has been specified. When you run this command, Git will remove all files and folders from the Working Directory it is tracking (files that Git tracks are stored in the repository, so nothing is lost) and pull all of the files and directories from the commit that the branch links to from the repository.

To accomplish this, the branch you want to switch to must be present in your local system, and any modifications made to your current branch must be committed or stashed before switching. This command can also be used to check out files. When you run this command, Git will remove all files and folders from the Working Directory it is tracking (files that Git tracks are stored in the repository, so nothing is lost) and pull all of the files and directories from the commit that the branch links to from the repository.</p>

Depending on your process, the parent branch can be either a development or a master branch. If there are no conflicts, it will make a new commit automatically. You should be on the branch you want to merge with your parent branch before running the git merge command.
