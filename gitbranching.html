        <p>This document is an in-depth review of the git branch command and a discussion of the overall Git branching model. Branching is a feature available in most modern version control systems. Branching in other VCS's can be an expensive operation in both time and disk space. <mark>In Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes.</mark> When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. This makes it harder for unstable code to get merged into the main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your future's history before merging it into the main branch.</p>
        <img class="hero-img" src="images/Gitbranch.svg " /> 
        <p>The diagram above visualizes a repository with two isolated lines of development, one for a little feature, and one for a longer-running feature. By developing them in branches, it’s not only possible to work on both of them in parallel, but it also keeps the main branch free from questionable code.</p>
        <p>The implementation behind Git branches is much more lightweight than other version control system models. Instead of copying files from directory to directory, Git stores a branch as a reference to a commit. In this sense, a branch represents the tip of a series of commits—it's not a container for commits. The history for a branch is extrapolated through the commit relationships.</p>

    <div class="container container-center">
        <h1>How it Works</h1>
        <p>A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.</p>
        <p>The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn’t let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-checkout">git checkout</a> and <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-merge">git merge</a> commands.</p>

        <h1>Common Options</h1>
        <section class="section ow">
            <p>git branch</p>
        </section>
        <br/>
        <p>List all of the branches in your repository. This is synonymous with git branch --list.</p>
        <section class="section ow">
            <p>git branch {branch}</p>
        </section>
        <br/>
        <p>Create a new branch called ＜branch＞. This does not check out the new branch.</p>
        <section class="section ow">
            <p>git branch -D {branch}</p>
        </section>
        <br/>
        <p>Force delete the specified branch, even if it has unmerged changes. This is the command to use if you want to permanently throw away all of the commits associated with a particular line of development.</p>
        <section class="section ow">
            <p>git branch -m  {branch}</p>
        </section>
        <br/>
        <p>Rename the current branch to ＜branch＞.</p>
        <section class="section ow">
            <p>git branch -a</p>
        </section>
        <br/>
        <p>List all remote branches. </p>
