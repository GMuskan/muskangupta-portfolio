        <p>Hactoberfest in Open Source initiative by <span class="heading-inverted"> Digital Ocean</span>  organized to encourage developers to contribute, participate to give back to the community. It’s a month long celebration of Open Source Software. It was started in 2014. People from all over the world contributed to make it a huge success. It is now a regular event in <span class="heading-inverted"> October every year</span>.</p>
        <p>There are many ways to contribute like -</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sign up for <span class="heading-inverted">GitHub</span> ( If you haven’t your GitHub account yet)</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Go to <span class="heading-inverted">Hactoberfest</span> website , Sign In using your GitHub credentials.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Find projects using Search bar at top left corner of GitHub page.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Search relevant issues which are open, not fixed. You can type <span class="heading-inverted">label:hactoberfest is:issue is:open</span></li>
            <br/>
            <li>You can also go to left navigation bar and search for <span class="heading-inverted">issues => states => open</span></li>
            <br/>
            <li>Then you can also select language like Python, JavaScript and check open issues in them.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>If you are a beginner and can’t find good issues then there’s tag <span class="heading-inverted">label:good first issue</span> which filters out issues for beginners who want to contribute.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Any issue which you want to contribute to which does not have a label of Hactoberfest label ; it would still count as a contribution to Hactoberfest if you do it in specified period <span class="heading-inverted">(1st to — 31st October ).</span> </li>
            <br/>
            <li>you can use <span class="heading-inverted">Visual Studio Code</span> to contribute. Also, download <span class="heading-inverted">GitHub Desktop</span>After selecting open issue then clone and fork it (download it) to your machine, edit, make necessary changes.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>That’s it ! Do finish the task and create <span class="heading-inverted">Pull Request</span> (PR)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>it's a common myth that open source developers are better programmers than the others. They are not. Start with the project which we use day to day. Visit their GitHub and check if there are any open issues to be solved ? If No, then find next project/product.</p>
        <p>Once you find the project, check if the PRs are regularly getting merged or not from contributors ? Go to the each issue and see if you can contribute.</p>
        <p>We use many software’s free just because they are open source for example<span class="heading-inverted">WordPress, Linux, blender.</span>  Doing open source is like giving back to the community.</p>
        <p>If you’re a beginner and don’t have a job in the industry then contributing to open source is a easiest way to get real-world software development experience. Just by doing this you network with great people of the industry and they review your code , give suggestions to improve and a lot other things. So, Just start contributing& make the world better place to live !</p>
