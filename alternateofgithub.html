            <h1>2. Bitbucket</h1>
            <p>Bitbucket is another high-performance replacement of Github purposely designed by Atlassian. This replacement permits one or more teams of project-management professionals to not only plan the lifecycle of their projects well but also collaborate authoritatively on code repositories with no worries about the deployments. Curious to know whether or not Bitbucket is helpful at times you are planning to develop quality software without making many changes!! Yes, with its secured workflows and Continuous Integration/ Continuous Deployment capabilities, the codes can be executed and reviewed well not only frequently but reliably too. All you need to do is import the prime repositories of GITHUB (if you are using it) to its replacement (i.e. Bitbucket) and start developing a lot of best-in-class software comprising of free as well as UNLIMITED REPOSITORIES</p>

            <h1>3. GitBucket</h1>
            <p>Isn’t it new to note the fact down that hosting source code is an unavoidable part of the software development process!! Github does host a collection of the code repositories of many of your software development projects but many times, it fails to reciprocate the flexibility demanded by any of your projects. There, its alternative GitBucket offers its extensibility at a higher scale which lets you or the other developers manage the project codes with lesser development challenges. Moreover, there are other core features offered by GitBucket instantaneously like PULL REQUESTS, REPOSITORY VIEWER (looks much alike to Windows Explorer but displays the repository’s content at a specific revision), issue tracker, a plugin system which draws out its core features potentially, documentation, & wiki.</p>

            <h1>4. AWS Code Commit</h1>
            <p>AWS CodeCommit hosts well PRIVATE CODE REPOSITORIES of any of your software projects. It is one of the reasons many organizations prefer to use this version control service over GitHub at times they are committed to collaborating securely with the existing code repositories encrypted in transit. Besides, this no-size limits GitHub’s alternative features easy access of repository source files and integration with AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, and AWS Management Console. Also, it helps a lot while transferring files in and out through HTTPS/SSH (SSH is a secured cryptographic network protocol helping system administrators particularly to access network services even in an unsecured network). What else is more required to convince you for picking this SECURED GITHUB’S ALTERNATIVE to store anything – from easily understandable code to good reliable binaries?</p>
